# Telegram-Channel-Cleaner
This Python script cleans a Telegram channel. It uses the Telethon library to delete messages in the middle of a channel's history, while preserving a specified number of the oldest messages (the first 10) and the newest messages (the last 10). It's configured via command-line arguments for safety.
